HTML Changes

    Added head section to the HTML structure for better semantic organization and to improve SEO.

    Added language toggle button (#language-toggle) for switching between English and Spanish. The button is integrated with the translation functionality.

    Included the favicon link for the siteâ€™s icon.

    Updated HTML structure to reflect changes in accessibility, including using aria-label for the language toggle button.

CSS Changes

    Added button-specific styles to a new dedicated buttons.css file:

        Standard button styles for color, border-radius, padding, and transitions.

        Hover and active button effects, including color changes and scale transformations.

        Specific button styles for the language toggle button (focused on color change for hover and active states).

Revised main CSS (styles.css) to remove any button-related styles and maintain the focus on general layout and design.

JavaScript Changes

    Created translation toggle functionality in script.js:

        Implemented dynamic language change between English and Spanish using language-specific JSON data.
        
        Added a simple language toggle button to change the text content dynamically.

General Site Updates
    
    Updated the footer to ensure it stays fixed at the bottom of the page instead of floating above the content.
    
    Introduced custom font styles with the Raleway font, applied throughout the site.
    
    Improved accessibility by adding aria-label for the language toggle button to indicate its function for screen readers.

File and Folder Structure Updates
    
    Created a new CSS file for button styles (buttons.css) to centralize button-related designs and improve maintainability.
    
    Cleaned up CSS to ensure better separation of concerns between layout and button-specific styles.
